# Electron.Net - Bitcoin Wallet
This is a simple **Bitcoin Wallet** I created for fun on the _Testnet_.
I am really interested in this whole DLT & Blockchain topic and with this little project I try to improve my skills :)

There are already way better solutions out there.

### I have planned to implement:

1. Create a simple layered .Net Core 2.0 Application
2. Build a _Business Layer_ based on the N/HBitcoin Framework
3. Build an ASP.Net MVC based _Frontend Layer_ and make the Wallet available as Electron.Net Desktop Application
